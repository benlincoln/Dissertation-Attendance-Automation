# Benjamin Clarke Project/Dissertation

This project is a system designed to automate an attendance system, using the user's location via validating their default gateway.

In this repository there are three components:
- Electron app, the product the end user will interact with
- An ASP.NET API to interact with my database
- A C# project that when ran, sets up an evironment to demonstrate the project

Completed as part of my BSc (Hons) in Computer Science at the University of Lincoln, Lincolnshire, UK.
